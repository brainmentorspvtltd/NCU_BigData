- Need of cloud computing
- Types of cloud computing
- Deployment Models
- Cloud Services
- Architecture of Cloud
- Google Cloud


- Suppose we want to build and host a webiste
  - developer team - machines + softwares
  - database team
  - server team
     - purchase
     - rent

Introduction to Cloud Computing
- it is the use of network of remote servers hosted on internet to store, manage and process data
- it is the delivery of computing services like servers, storage, databases, software, analytics over the internet

3 important characterstics of cloud computing
- on-demand and self-service (launch any service any time without intervention)
- elasticity (scale up and down easily)
- measure service (pay what you use)


Benefits of Cloud
- Speed
- Cost
- Scalability
- Accessiblity
- Security


Types of cloud computing
- Deployment Models
  - Public Cloud
  - Private Cloud - services and infrastructure are maintained on a private network
  - Hybrid Cloud  - Public + Private

- Cloud Services Models
  - IaaS - Infrastructre as a Service
    - we rent IT infrastructure (Server, Network) from a cloud provider on 
      pay-as-you-go basis
  - PaaS - Platform as a Service
    - platform on which software can be developed and deployed
    - Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk
  - SaaS - Software as a Service
    - cloud providers host and manage the software application on a subscription       basis
    - Microsoft 365, Google Docs


Architecture of Cloud Computing
- Cloud is data center internally
- Data center has multiple physical servers
- on top of physical servers we have virtual environment
- on top of virtual environment we have virtual servers
