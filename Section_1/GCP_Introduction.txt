- Need of cloud computing
- Types of cloud computing
- Deployment Models
- Cloud Services
- Architecture of cloud environment
- Google Cloud Platform

- Suppose you want to build and host a website
  - tools for coding platform
  - database
  - server


Cloud Computing
- use of network of remote servers hosted on internet to store, manage and process data
- storing or accessing your data over the internet

- it is the delivery of computing services
  - server
  - storage
  - databases
  - networking
  - software
  - analytics


3 most important characterstics of cloud computing
- on-demand & self-serviced - launch anytime without manuel intervention
- elasticity - scale up and down
- measurd service - pay what you use

Advantages of cloud
- speed
- cost
- scalability
- accessibility
- security


Deployment Models
- Public  - AWS, Azure
- Private - AWS
- Hybrid  - Public + Private


Service Models
- IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service
  - we rent IT insfrastructure (server and networks..) from cloud provide on 
    pay-as-you-go basis
- PaaS - Platform as a Service
  - a platform on which software can be developed and deployed
- SaaS - Software as a Service
  - cloud providers host and manage the software application on subscription basis


Architecture of Cloud Environment
- Cloud is data center inside
- Data center has physical servers
- on top of physical servers we have virtualization environment
- on top of virtualization environment we have virtual server
