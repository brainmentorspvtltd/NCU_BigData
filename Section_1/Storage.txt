Storage

Block Storage          - GCP VMs - Persisten Disk
Immutable Blobs        - Cloud Storage
RDBMS                  - CloudSQL & CloudSpanner
NoSQL                  - Key-Value - BigTable
NoSQL Database         - DataStore
Import Data in Cloud   - Transfer Service

Google Cloud Storage
- RESTFUL Online file storage web service for storing and accessing data on google cloud
- It's an IaaS
- it could also be accessed globally via HTTP URL
- Auto Scalable

Terminology
- Buckets
  - These are the containers that hold your data
- Bucket Name
  - Bucket Names are always unique globally
- Bucket Lables
  - It's a key and value pair metadata, that allows you to group your bucket
- Objects
  - Individual piece of data

Versioning
- Cloud storage allows to version the stored objects
- we need to enable versioning explicitly, if we don't set versioning then new objects terminates the old...


Life Cycle
- Life cycle management policy
- we create a json for life cycle steps
